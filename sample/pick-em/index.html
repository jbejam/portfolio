        <h3>Pick-EM</h3>

        <h6>I developed a NFL pick-em game as a Wordpress plugin.</h6>
        <br>
        <p> A pick-em game is a pool where friends join together to try to guess the scores of NFL games, week by week.
            Players could sign up for the app via magic.link and make their picks for the sequencing weeks until the end of NFL season.
            Players could check their scores and picks in a leader-board UI.
        The leaderboard provided players tools to view each week picks and scores with different formats and tables. </p>
